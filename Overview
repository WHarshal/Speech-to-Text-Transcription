# Project Overview: Hindi Speech-to-Text Transcription, Translation, and Sentiment Analysis

## Summary

This project provides an end-to-end pipeline for analyzing Hindi-language audio files, such as call center recordings, to understand customer sentiment. Developed entirely within a Jupyter Notebook, the pipeline performs transcription, translation, and sentiment analysis, allowing for a structured and reproducible approach to analyzing audio data in a Hindi-speaking context.

## Key Pipeline Stages

1. **Audio Processing and Display**:
   - The audio file is loaded, and key parameters (channels, sample rate, sample width, etc.) are extracted.
   - The waveform and spectrogram of the audio are visualized to understand the signal's structure and features.

2. **Audio Segmentation**:
   - The audio file is segmented into 30-second chunks to ensure manageable input for the transcription model. A sampling rate of 16,000 Hz is used for processing efficiency.

3. **Transcription and Translation**:
   - **Transcription**: Transcribes the segmented Hindi audio into text using a pre-trained model.
   - **Translation**: The Hindi transcription is translated into English, allowing sentiment analysis to be conducted on a more widely supported language for NLP.

4. **Word Error Rate (WER) Calculation**:
   - WER is calculated based on substitution, deletion, and insertion errors in the transcription. This provides a quantitative measure of transcription accuracy and model reliability.

5. **Sentiment Analysis**:
   - The English text is analyzed for sentiment, giving insights into customer emotions (e.g., positive, negative, or neutral) which can be used for customer feedback and service quality improvements.

## Project Features

- **Single Notebook Pipeline**: The entire workflow is implemented in a single Jupyter Notebook, providing ease of use and modification.
- **Configurable Segmentation**: Audio segments are adjustable to different lengths to adapt to various transcription needs.
- **Comprehensive Visualizations**: Waveforms and spectrograms give a clear visual representation of the audio, aiding in interpretation and troubleshooting.
- **Transcription and Translation Accuracy Metrics**: WER calculation gives a performance metric for transcription accuracy, which can guide future model improvements.

## Usage Example

For customer service analytics, this pipeline can:
- Transcribe customer calls in Hindi, providing textual records of conversations
- Translate Hindi text to English, broadening accessibility for analysis
- Perform sentiment analysis on translated text, providing actionable insights to improve customer service quality

## Technologies Used

- **Numpy and Librosa**: For audio loading, processing, and visualization
- **Matplotlib**: For waveform and spectrogram plotting
- **Whisper Model**: For accurate Hindi transcription and translation

## Potential Extensions

- Adding support for live transcription in real-time scenarios
- Expanding language support for dialects and regional Hindi variants
- Deploying the pipeline in a production environment for automated and continuous customer service monitoring

This pipeline provides a straightforward way to extract and analyze insights from Hindi audio data, making it valuable for businesses seeking customer sentiment insights in Hindi-speaking markets.
